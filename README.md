# VoCrucior UI
This repository serves for distribution of the vocrucior scripts. They are not autoconfig files, as they were developed completely ingame.
If someone wants to make them autoconfig files, please, be my guest.

## Usage
- Choose the file fitting for your VoCrucior variation and copy the content. 
- Then apply ingame to the COCKPIT via the paste function for the whole lua script.
- Remove the emitter and receivers, as well as all Programming Boards, they are not needed anymore since the Demeter Update.
- Link the fuel tanks in the order as seen inside the script.
- You should be good to go!

## Functionality
This script suite aims to be fairly minimalistic and give you information about speed and acceleration, as well as the general fuel levels.
The fuel levels are averaged, which means, each category of fuel tanks when named either "AtmoMain", "SpaceMain", "SpaceUtil" are shown as one bar. 
It is recommended that the grouped fuel tanks are on similar fuel levels and consume similar amounts.

Features include:
- Averaged fuel tanks
- ClassicUI mode for the weirdos that liked the old brake display and atmo only text
- Brake display with optional brake toggle (parameters)
- Atmo-only mode with display, colors modifiable via parameters
- Size and position-adjustable acceleration and speed graph (parameters)
- Parameter to enable/disable buildhelper
- and more stuff. Consult the help and info commands ingame.

Feel free to take from the script what you want, modify it, distribute it, just don't sell the parts that stay the same, as your creation.
You know, the whole credit thing. If someone wants to continue development of the scripts with the goal of staying fairly minimalistic (sorry, ArchHUD is not minimalistic)
feel free to do so.
